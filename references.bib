@PhDThesis{thesis,
   abstract            = {The success of diffusion MRI is deeply rooted in
                         the fact that during their micrometric random
                         displacements water molecules explore tissue
                         microstructure. Hence by labeling magnetically
                         spins of displaced water, diffusion MRI provides
                         us with exquisite information about the sizes and
                         orientations on the multiple compartments present
                         inside an imaging voxel. Through the causal
                         relation between on one hand the imaged
                         restricted and oriented water mobility and on the
                         other hand the axonal orientations in brain white
                         matter, diffusion MRI has become a powerful
                         method to infer fiber tract architecture and
                         brain anatomic connectivity. This work is not
                         only a journey that takes us from essential
                         diffusion MRI physics to an investigation of the
                         brain neuronal circuitry, but also a thesis
                         aiming at demonstrating the power of large scale
                         analysis of brain connectivity, where every
                         technological component is essential. After a
                         short introduction on molecular diffusion and
                         diffusion NMR, we start by showing that diffusion
                         contrast is positive. This key issue that was
                         only postulated up to now, allows us to justify
                         why diffusion can be computed accurately with the
                         only signal modulus. Accordingly, various
                         emerging MRI techniques that map non-Gaussian
                         diffusion have found a sound justification. In
                         particular it is precisely the result that allows
                         us to map distribution of diffusion related spin
                         displacements by Fourier transformation of the
                         measured signal modulus, hence to do Diffusion
                         Spectrum MRI. We show through multiples MR
                         experiments how the shape of this distribution in
                         a complicated multi-compartment biological system
                         can be measured and how its characteristic local
                         heterogeneity is a mirror of fiber architectures.
                         We discuss in detail its interpretation and its
                         relation to other diffusion MRI techniques.
                         Tractography is the necessary link that from
                         diffusion MRI provides us with nerve fiber
                         trajectories and maps of brain axonal
                         connectivity. In this thesis two algorithms are
                         proposed, while the first is designed for
                         diffusion tensor MRI, the second is shaped for
                         high angular resolution diffusion MRI and
                         specifically tested on Diffusion Spectrum MRI.
                         After having considered the potentials and the
                         limitations of these line generation algorithms,
                         we investigate whether tractography can be
                         formulated as a segmentation problem in a high
                         dimensional non Euclidean space, i.e.
                         position-orientation space. With the help of the
                         developed tools we address some key
                         neuro-scientific questions. Based on diffusion
                         tensor MRI data of 32 healthy volunteers,
                         language networks are investigated. It is shown
                         that right-handed men are massively
                         interconnected between the left-hemisphere speech
                         areas whereas the homologous in the right
                         hemisphere are sparse; furthermore
                         interhemispheric connections between the speech
                         areas and their contralatera1 homologues are
                         relatively strong. Women and left-handed men have
                         equally strong intrahemispheric connections in
                         both hemispheres, but women have a higher density
                         of interhemispheric connections. After this
                         quantitative study, Diffusion Spectrum MRI data
                         of a single subject is collected and tractography
                         performed in order to analyze the global
                         connectivity pattern of the human brain. For this
                         purpose we propose to model this large scale
                         architecture by an abstract graph. It is shown
                         that the long-range axonal network exhibits a
                         "small world" topology. This type of particular
                         architecture is present in various large scale
                         communication networks. They emerge usually from
                         a growing process where optimal communication has
                         to be developed under some resource constraints.
                         Furthermore we show also that the architecture of
                         axonal connectivity between cortical areas
                         exhibits a hierarchical organization. These
                         results, which confirm more indirect studies,
                         provide essential material to discuss not only
                         brain evolution and development but also
                         information processing at the level of the brain.},
